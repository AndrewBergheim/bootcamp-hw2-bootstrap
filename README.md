# bootcamp-hw1 by Andrew Bergheim

## Description
This is a portfolio that I created as part of my coding bootcamp at the University of Arizona beginning in October 2019. It was created as an exercise
to practice using Bootstrap, a framework and library for web development. As of November 8, 2019, it also serves as my publically available portfolio for prospective collaborators and employers. 

## Installation

The three HTML files, style.css and the images contained within this repository are all ready to use and will work properly when hosted using your preferred hosting provider, or can be edited and used offline if you so wish. Much of the CSS and a large portion of the scripts are hosted externally by bootstrap (https://www.getbootstrap.com) so not all content is guaranteed to be available in the long term or while offline.

## Usage

From the initial page (index.html), the portfolio page (portfolio.html) and the contact page (contact.html) can be accessed by clicking on their respective links in the header.  

## Credits

Most components would not have been possible without the wonderful bootstrap documentation available at (https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.3/getting-started/introduction/)

Credit also goes to W3schools (w3schools.com/css/) for their excellent CSS tutorials, as well as my instructors at the University of Arizona Coding Bootcamp, provided by Trinity Educational Services.
